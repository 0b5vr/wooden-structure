# Wooden Structure

![Wooden Structure](./dist/wooden-structure.png)

2KB executable graphics for Outline Online 2021

Made with slightly modified [Blossom](https://github.com/lunasorcery/Blossom) by yx.

Inspired by the Byte Battle experience in [Outline Online 2021](https://outlinedemoparty.nl/).

Manually edit `frag_draw.h` (the output of shader minifier) and replace all for loops to `for(int Z=0;Z<n;Z++){` to make it actually 2kb ðŸ¥³+ðŸ˜Ž+ðŸ˜­
